# Particle Image Animation

## **Description**
This project creates a **dynamic particle animation that interacts with the user's mouse movement**.
<br>The animation is based on an image, with each particle representing a pixel of the image.
<br>The particles are **attracted back to their original position**, creating a mesmerizing visual effect.

## **Features**
- **Interactive Animation** : Particles move away from the mouse cursor and smoothly return to their original positions.
- **Dynamic Particle Behavior** : Particles react to mouse proximity with smooth easing and friction effects.
- **Image-Based Particle Initialization** : Particles are initialized based on the pixels of an image.
- **Warp Effect** : Clicking the "Warp" button randomly repositions the particles, creating a warp effect.

## **Prerequisites**
- A modern web browser that supports **HTML5** and **JavaScript**.
